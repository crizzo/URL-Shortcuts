How to Use
Copy a URL to your clipboard (e.g., from Safari).
Run the shortcut from the Shortcuts app or Home Screen.
The shortened URL will be copied to your clipboard and shown in a notification.
Notes
Replace YOUR_BITLY_API_TOKEN with your actual Bitly token.
This uses Bitlyâ€™s free tier (1,000 shortens/month).
You can share this shortcut via iCloud by exporting it once created, but users will need to input their own API token.
