Complete Shortcut Example
Here’s how it looks in the Shortcuts app:

Action 1: Get Clipboard
Action 2: Get Contents of URL
Method: POST
URL: https://api-ssl.bitly.com/v4/shorten
Headers:
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BITLY_API_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
Body: {"long_url": "Clipboard", "domain": "bit.ly"}
Action 3: Get Dictionary Value (Key: link)
Action 4: Copy to Clipboard (Dictionary Value)
Action 5: Show Notification ("Short URL copied: Dictionary Value")
How to Use
Copy a URL to your clipboard (e.g., from Safari).
Run the shortcut from the Shortcuts app or Home Screen.
The shortened URL will be copied to your clipboard and shown in a notification.
Notes
Replace YOUR_BITLY_API_TOKEN with your actual Bitly token.
This uses Bitly’s free tier (1,000 shortens/month).
You can share this shortcut via iCloud by exporting it once created, but users will need to input their own API token.
